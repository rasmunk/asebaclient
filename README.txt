## Before the aseba client can speak to a thymio robot it needs access to a dbus connection
## These scripts will create this dbus connection on boot
## Relies on asebamedulla, asebaswitch binaries being compiled on the system
## Can be found at https://Rasz@bitbucket.org/enurobotlab/default_configuration.git

## Client source is taken from https://github.com/aseba-community/aseba/tree/master/examples/clients
